							<h2>Project Overview</h2>
							<p>
								Before I dive into my experience with NASA L’SPACE, allow me to first elaborate upon the significance of this program. The NASA L’SPACE Program 
								is a 12-week interactive experience for undergraduate STEM students, aiming to prepare them for a career in the space industry. It is designed 
								to provide unique, hands-on learning and insight into the dynamic world of this industry, teaching students NASA mission procedures and protocols 
								from industry professionals. There are two L’SPACE academies, and I was a part of the Mission Concept Academy (MCA), where I collaborated with a 
								team of 12 to complete a mission-related team project. Every term there is a new project, and for my term, Spring 2024, we were tasked with 
								developing a Mars rover mission concept built to perform science on the surface and subsurface of Mars.
							</p>
	
							<h3>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>
							
							<p>
								I initially took the position of Computer Hardware Engineer and worked primarily on the Command and Data Handling (CDH) subsystem of the rover, 
								covering the data computing and telecommunication subassemblies. However, after completing the SRR, I was offered a promotion to Deputy Project 
								Manager, where I helped lead the project alongside the Project Manager and directed a Programmatics subteam, covering risk management, budget, 
								and scheduling. Amongst the two roles that I’ve mentioned, after the SRR, I was responsible for both for the remainder of the project.
							</p>

								<h3>Academy Deliverables</h3>
								<p>
									NASA L’SPACE MCA was broken up into 6 deliverables that are based on NASA’s Space Flight Project Life Cycle from NPR 7120.5E. Given the academy 
									is conceptual, we followed this design process until the end of Phase B, which is the last phase before the design is finalized and fabrication 
									of the rover begins. Below are listed the 6 deliverables that we were assigned, which span the pre-formulation and formulation of a traditional 
									NASA project life cycle.

							<h3>Associated Organizations</h3>
							<p>
								The NASA L'SPACE Mission Concept Academy (MCA) project is supported by several key organizations. Arizona State University (ASU) provides academic resources, 
								faculty expertise, and research facilities essential for the project's development. NASA offers guidance and mentorship, ensuring project deliverables meet 
								professional space mission standards. LUCY, NASA's Trojan asteroid mission, serves as a practical benchmark, helping students apply their knowledge to real-world 
								scenarios. Siemens supplies advanced technological tools and software, provides courses on CAD, offers free software access, and allows students to take an 
								accelerated course after the academy.

						<h2>Personal Contributions</h2>
						<p>
							Throughout my tenure in the project, I undertook multiple roles that contributed significantly to the success of our mission. I was the Deputy Project Manager, 
							oversaw the Command and Data Handling (CDH) subsystem, and am now leading a revision committee aimed at refining our main PDR deliverable to achieve a professional evaluation. 
							See below for details on these various roles and their contributions to the project.
						</p>

						<h3>Team Management</h3>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									<p>
										As the Deputy Project Manager, I co-led Team 26 alongside the Project Manager and directed the Programmatics sub-team, overseeing the development of the project 
										budget, schedule, and risk management strategies.
									</p>
			
									<p>
										I facilitated the completion of key project deliverables, including the MDR, PDR, and Final PDR Presentation. This involved guiding the team through each iterative 
										phase, setting up peer review systems, regularly checking in with teammates to ensure progress, and creating sub-deadlines leading up to the final deliverables. 
										Additionally, I served as a key liaison between the Science and Engineering teams, ensuring cross-functional coordination and effective communication.
									</p>
			
									<p>
										Our final PDR deliverable received exceptional praise for its high-quality contributions, technical understanding, and effort. The feedback highlighted the 
										excellence of our work, noting its industry-level standards and recommending minor revisions for potential resubmission to achieve professional evaluation status. 
										This recognition places our work among the best in the program, showcasing our team's dedication and expertise.

						<h3>Command and Data Handling (CDH) Subsystem</h3>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<p>
									As the Computer Hardware Engineer, I was solely responsible for the Command and Data Handling (CDH) subsystem of the Endurance rover. This subsystem 
									includes the telecommunications, data computing, and software architecture subassemblies. My key contributions are outlined below:
								</p>
		
								<ul class="list-margin">
									<li>
										<b>Requirements Development:</b> Created the lower-level requirements used to design the CDH subsystem, ensuring alignment with mission goals and constraints.
									</li>
		
									<li>
										<b>Component Selection:</b> Determined the sub-components for each subassembly using trade studies. Evaluations considered factors such as power draw, mass, cost, 
										temperature resistance, radiation resistance, and Technology Readiness Level (TRL).
									</li>
		
									<li>
										<b>Risk Management:</b> Identified potential risks and implemented redundancy to enhance the reliability and robustness of the rover.
									</li>
		
									<li>
										<b>Mass and Power Specifications:</b> Determined the maximum mass, volume, and power draw for the CDH subsystem to ensure compliance with mission constraints.
									</li>
		
									<li>
										<b>Verification and Validation:</b> Outlined system Verification and Validation (V&V) plans for the CDH subsystem to ensure all components meet the necessary 
										requirements.
									</li>
		
									<li>
										<b>Software Architecture:</b> Created a software architecture flowchart detailing how the spacecraft handles data, facilitating efficient data processing and 
										communication.
									</li>
		
									<li>
										<b>Manufacturing and Procurement:</b> Developed the CDH subsystem manufacturing and procurement plans, ensuring timely and cost-effective production and integration 
										of all components.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<p>
									These contributions were critical to the successful design and implementation of the CDH subsystem, ensuring it meets the rigorous demands of the Endurance mission.

						<h3>Revision Committee</h3>
						<p>
							Building on the high evaluation status of our PDR, Team 26’s Project Manager, Anna Diaz, and I have established and are currently leading a sub-team from the now-retired Team 26. 
							This revision team consists of 7 members who will work over the Summer of 2024 to further refine the PDR with the goal of achieving a professional rating, a rare accomplishment 
							in the academy's history. In alignment with the structure of the Mission Concept Academy, Anna Diaz and I have divided the deliverables into iterative phases. We have also 
							implemented peer review systems, regularly check in with teammates to ensure progress, and conduct weekly meetings to maintain momentum and focus.
