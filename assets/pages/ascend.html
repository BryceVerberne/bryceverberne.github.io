						<h2>Project Overview</h2>
						<p>
							As a member of the Sun Devil Satellite Laboratory (SDSL) at Arizona State University’s Fulton School, I have has 
							the opportunity to work on ASCEND–a comprehensive aerospace program that embodies the full 
							“design-build-fly-operate-analyze” cycle of a space mission. ASCEND (Aerospace Scholarships to Challenge and 
							Educate New Discoverers) is an Arizona Space Grant Consortium Workforce Development initiative that brings 
							together undergraduate teams from across Arizona. 
						</p>

						<p>
							We are the StratoDevils, a team consisting of a multidisciplinary undergraduates broken into mechanical, electrical, 
							software, and telemetry subteams. Our goal is to design and build a payload that will be lifted by a high-altitude 
							weather balloon to altitudes excess of 100,000 feet. This hands-on project not only challenges us to integrate imaging 
							and tracking technologies with atmospheric and thermal experiments but also prepares us for real-world aerospace research 
							and development. The culmination of our data analysis is then presented at major events like the NASA Undergraduate 
							Research Symposium annually. 
						</p>

						<h3>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>

						<p>
							As the Deputy Software Lead, my responsibilities span project management, team coordination, and hands-on development. 
							I guide a team of 10 members, focusing on using Agile methodologies to manage the complexities of software development. 
							Through week-long sprints managed via Jira, and extensive use of Git and GitHub for collaborative coding, our team 
							develops robust software primarily in C++ and Python, crucial for both flight operations and data analysis.
						</p>

						<h3>Associated Organizations</h3>

						<p>
							ASCEND is a collaborative initiative involving several key organizations. The Sun Devil Satellite Laboratory (SDSL) at 
							ASU spearheads the project, providing the leadership and technical expertise necessary to design and develop the payload. 
							The initiative is part of the Arizona Space Grant program, which is funded by NASA, highlighting the significant role that 
							NASA plays in supporting space-focused education and research. Additionally, the ANSR team is instrumental in coordinating 
							the launch operations, ensuring that our payloads are successfully integrated with the high-altitude weather balloons. 
							Together, these organizations—SDSL, NASA Arizona State University, Arizona Space Grant, and ANSR—make this project 
							possible.

						<h3>Project Management &amp; Leadership</h3>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<p>
									In my role as Deputy Software Lead, I co-manage the Software team consisting of 10-members alongside the Software Lead. 
									Together, we oversee the development of flight software, ground software, and data processing systems. I implemented 
									industry-relevant practices and fostered a fast-paced, quality-driven environment by adopting Agile methodologies.
								</p>
								<p>
									To address previous project challenges, I spearheaded the adoption of <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">
									Jira</a> and Scrum management. I broke down our work into one-week sprints, each culminating in a retrospective. As Scrum 
									Master, I managed our project board, identified bottlenecks, coached team members, and leveraged Jira metrics to drive 
									continuous process improvements.
								</p>
								<p>
									I organized our software team into three specialized subteams—flight software (FSW), ground software (GSW), and data 
									processing—while actively contributing to each area. My hands-on approach not only advanced the development efforts but 
									also fostered strong inter-team communication, ensuring seamless integration of all software components.

						<h3>Flight Software (FSW)</h3>
						<p>
							Beyond my project management and leadership roles, I have been actively involved in the design and development of the payload’s 
							flight software, primarily written in C++. Working with a dedicated four-member team, we focus on critical functions such as 
							payload bootup, data collection, storage, and transmission during flight.
						<p>
							A key enhancement I led was transitioning from CSV-based data handling (used in Fall 2024) to a more efficient packet-based 
							system. This upgrade significantly improves data storage efficiency and minimizes data loss. I enhanced several scientific 
							sensors (e.g., BME680, MTK33339) to support packet formatting and updated our flash memory protocols to ensure reliable data 
							writes and reads.
						</p>
						<p>
							Special emphasis was placed on optimizing the onboard <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5643">W25Q128 SPI flash memory</a>. 
							Building on my initial experience integrating flash into the payload in Fall 2024, I advanced its development by designing an onboard 
							file system to effectively manage and distinguish different types of flight data. Additionally, I introduced payload commands 
							(e.g., DELETE, DOWNLOAD F#, STATUS) to improve communication with the ground software (GSW) and provided ongoing mentorship to the FSW 
							team to maintain steady progress.
						</p>

						<h3>Ground Software (GSW)</h3>
						<p>
							In parallel with my FSW contributions, I have been actively involved in the development of the ground software, primarily written 
							in Python. Our four-member GSW team focuses on ensuring smooth communication between the ground station and the payload, handling 
							data reception, processing, and routing.
						</p>
						<p>
							We developed a multi-threaded pipeline system that breaks the ground software into serial input, serial sorter, and packet decoder 
							modules, ensuring the system can keep pace with data demands. I was responsible for developing the packet decoder module, which 
							dissects each packet to extract validation bytes (e.g., sync bytes, checksum) and converts scientific sensor data into CSV format 
							for subsequent routing to 3D and 2D data processing. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The ground software is still under development as we work towards interfacing GSW with payload commands and shifting from a serial 
							interface to an intuitive GUI for improved controls.
						</p>

						<h3>Data Processing</h3>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<p>
									In addition to my contributions to FSW and GSW, I played a key role in enhancing our data processing efforts. Our 
									three-member Data Processing team focuses on converting post-flight data into useful visualizations that drive scientific 
									understanding. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Most notably, I developed the software that bridged the gap between raw data and its visualization. Drawing on my 
									experience with <a href="https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/">CesiumJS</a> from my 
									<a href="https://bryceverberne.com/assets/pages/satcomm-optimizer.html">SatComm Optimizer project</a>, I used JavaScript, 
									HTML, and CSS to animate the payload’s movements using longitude, latitude, and height data derived from Fall 2024’s launch. 
									By incorporating timestamps for each flight data point, the animated payload accuracy reflects the real-time intervals 
									observed during the flight, providing an interactive and precise model for data analysis. To streamline the process, I 
									developed a Python-based data parser that converts raw GPS data into a Cesium-readable JSON format. 
								</p>
								<p>
									This framework is still a work in progress as we aim to improve its scientific capabilities—such as displaying atmospheric 
									layers and calculating real-time speed. I am leading our data processing team as we evolve these visualizations toward the 
									goal of displaying live data during the payload’s ascent and descent.

						<h3>Project Management &amp; Leadership</h3>
						<p>
							In Fall 2024, I began my journey with ASCEND as a member of the Software team. I was highly proactive—frequently mentoring peers and even 
							hosting my own office hours to facilitate progress. Recognized for these efforts, I was quickly promoted to Deputy Software Lead, where I 
							co-managed a 6-member team alongside the Software Lead. In this role, I focused on fostering clear communication among team members, 
							ensuring everyone was aligned with project requirements and tasks. Additionally, I remained actively involved in software development, 
							using my hands-on experience to guide and mentor the team.
						</p>

						<h3>Flight Software (FSW)</h3>
						<p>
							Beyond my leadership responsibilities, I played a key role in advancing the flight software onboard the payload. Most notably, I 
							refactored the ASCEND legacy codebase to a modular, object-oriented design in C++, which allowed for seamless integration of new hardware 
							and sensor interfaces (e.g., INA260, SGP30) and supported faster communication protocols like I2C and SPI. Moreover, I was responsible 
							for incorporating the W25Q128 SPI flash memory onto the payload, establishing a more reliable storage solution compared to SD cards. I 
							developed the foundational software that ensures data is read and written reliably, effectively preventing overwrites and data corruption.
