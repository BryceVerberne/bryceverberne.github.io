						<h2>Project Overview</h2>
						<p>
							Before I dive into my experience with the Coconut CubeSat, allow me to first elaborate on the Sun Devil Satellite Laboratory (SDSL) 
							and provide some details about the project. I work for the SDSL, a Fulton Student Organization at ASU dedicated to the design and 
							development of satellite and satellite-related technology. SDSL participates in various projects, including the annual AIAA CanSat 
							Competition, the Pulsed Plasma Thruster (PPT) in collaboration with JPL NASA, and, of course, the Coconut CubeSat, among many others!
						</p>
						<p>
							Currently, I am working with a team at the Sun Devil Satellite Laboratory (SDSL) on the Coconut CubeSat, a 1U satellite designed to relay 
							information from remote sensing devices back to the ground station at Arizona State University. This project is particularly significant for 
							SDSL, as NASA has selected the Coconut CubeSat for the CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI). Our CubeSat competed against designs from notable 
							universities such as Harvard and Columbia in the selection process and has been scheduled for launch into orbit in May 2025.

							for more information on CSLI and the selection process.
						</p>

						<h3>Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>
						<p>
							As a Software Engineer on the Coconut CubeSat project at SDSL, I contribute to the development and deployment of software for satellite 
							operations using Ubuntu and other Linux distributions. We follow Agile methodologies, incorporating iterative phases, regular reviews 
							and feedback, and cross-functional collaboration among the software, electrical, and mechanical sub-teams.
						</p>

						<h3>Associated Organizations</h3>
						<p>
							The Coconut CubeSat is a collaboration between the Sun Devil Satellite Laboratory (SDSL), the Interplanetary Initiative at ASU, and NASA. 
							The project is divided into deliverables (e.g., PDR, PPRR, CDR) based on NASAâ€™s Space Flight Project Life Cycle. These deliverables represent 
							the culmination of work from both SDSL and the Interplanetary Initiative, regularly reviewed by NASA, with feedback provided to ensure a 
							steady development and refinement process leading up to and following the launch.

						<h2>Personal Contributions</h2>

						<h3>Command, Control, &amp; Communication</h3>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<p>
									As a Software Engineer on the Coconut CubeSat project, I facilitate command, control, and communication between the flight software 
									onboard the satellite and the ground software at Arizona State University. I utilize <a href="https://openc3.com/">OpenC3 COSMOS</a>, 
									an industry-standard software used by organizations such as NASA and Northrop Grumman. My role involves configuring OpenC3 COSMOS to 
									send commands and receive telemetry over a hardline FTDI connection, with plans to transition to communication over a LoRa radio module.
								</p>

								<p>
									I manage peripherals such as UARTs, I2C, and SPI serial communication, ensuring seamless two-way transmission by configuring Space Packet 
									CCSDS protocols for OpenC3 COSMOS interpretation. Additionally, I develop and debug C code for the flight and ground software running on 
									an ARM Cortex microcontroller with RTOS in Ubuntu, ensuring that data packets are transmitted and received accurately.
